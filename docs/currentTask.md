# Current Task: OAuth Bridge Fully Operational

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The OAuth bridge is now fully functional and ready for third-party integration. All critical issues have been resolved and the system has been verified working end-to-end with MCP server integration.

## Recent Accomplishments (2025-10-19)

### 1. Fixed OAuth Flow for Third-Party Integration
**Problems Identified and Resolved:**

#### Issue 1: JSON Response Instead of HTML Form
When MCP server initiated OAuth with `platform_url` in the URL, the server returned raw JSON instead of the login interface.

**Solution:**
- Added Accept header detection to distinguish between browser navigation and fetch requests
- Browser requests (`Accept: text/html`) → Show HTML form
- JavaScript fetch (`Accept: application/json`) → Return JSON response
- Lines 357-358 in [`src/handlers/authorize/index.ts`](src/handlers/authorize/index.ts:357-358)

#### Issue 2: Polling Endpoint 404 Errors
Polling endpoint was failing because path check didn't account for API Gateway stage prefixes.

**Solution:**
- Changed from exact match to suffix match: `event.path.endsWith('/authorize/poll')`
- Now handles `/dev/authorize/poll`, `/main/authorize/poll`, etc.
- Line 348 in [`src/handlers/authorize/index.ts`](src/handlers/authorize/index.ts:348)

#### Issue 3: Platform URL Pre-population
Form needed to support both pre-populated and manual entry flows.

**Solution:**
- Added `value="{{platform_url}}"` to input field
- Updated template variable replacement logic
- Lines 182, 425 in [`src/handlers/authorize/index.ts`](src/handlers/authorize/index.ts:182)

#### Issue 4: Iframe Breaking OAuth Flow (Critical)
Initial fix used iframe with sandbox permissions, but IB login navigated the entire browser window, breaking the polling mechanism.

**Solution:**
- Replaced iframe with popup window approach (original working design)
- Used `window.open(data.loginUrl, 'ib_login', 'width=800,height=600')`
- Main page continues polling while user completes login in popup
- Lines 195-202, 267-270 in [`src/handlers/authorize/index.ts`](src/handlers/authorize/index.ts:195-202)

### 2. Verified End-to-End OAuth Flow
**Successful Test Results:**
- ✅ MCP server initiates OAuth with platform_url parameter
- ✅ HTML form displays with pre-populated platform URL
- ✅ User clicks "Continue to Login" button
- ✅ Popup window opens with IntelligenceBank login
- ✅ Main page polls for completion every second
- ✅ User completes authentication in popup
- ✅ Polling detects completion: `Session info received: { hasSid: true, hasApiUrl: true }`
- ✅ Authorization code generated and returned
- ✅ Redirect to MCP callback: `https://mcp.connectingib.com/callback?code=...&state=...`

### 3. Confirmed Token Refresh Implementation
**Verification:**
- ✅ Token refresh fully implemented in [`src/handlers/token/index.ts`](src/handlers/token/index.ts:214-294)
- ✅ Refresh limits enforced (1,000 max refreshes, session age validation)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation in [`docs/api-documentation.md`](docs/api-documentation.md:140-170)
- ✅ Client integration examples in [`docs/client-integration.md`](docs/client-integration.md:209-278)
- ✅ Session management best practices documented

## Current System State

### Deployment Status
- **Environment**: Development (dev)
- **Deployed**: 2025-10-19 02:18 PM AEDT
- **Status**: ✅ Fully Operational
- **Endpoint**: `https://66qz7xd2w8.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/`

### Supported OAuth Flows

#### Flow A: Pre-populated Platform URL (MCP Server Pattern)
```
1. MCP Server → GET /authorize?client_id=xyz&platform_url=https://facu.intelligencebank.com&...
2. OAuth Bridge → Returns HTML form with pre-populated platform_url
3. User → Clicks "Continue to Login"
4. JavaScript → Fetches with Accept: application/json
5. OAuth Bridge → Returns JSON: {"loginUrl": "...", "token": "..."}
6. Browser → Opens popup window with IB login URL
7. Main Page → Polls /authorize/poll?token=... every second
8. User → Completes login in popup window
9. Polling → Detects completion, returns redirect_url
10. Browser → Redirects to callback with authorization code
11. MCP Server → Exchanges code for tokens via /token endpoint
```

#### Flow B: Manual Platform URL Entry
```
1. Client → GET /authorize?client_id=xyz&...
2. OAuth Bridge → Returns HTML form with empty platform_url field
3. User → Enters IB platform URL manually
4. User → Clicks "Continue to Login"
5. [Same as Flow A from step 4 onwards]
```

### Token Lifecycle
```
Initial Login
    ↓
Access Token (1 hour) + Refresh Token (30 days)
    ↓
After 1 hour → Access Token expires
    ↓
Client detects 401 from IB API
    ↓
Client calls /token with grant_type=refresh_token
    ↓
New Access Token (1 hour) + New Refresh Token (30 days)
    ↓
[Repeat until session expires or refresh limit reached]
    ↓
Session Expiry (24 hours typical) → Full re-authentication required
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Monitor MCP server integration for any edge cases
- [ ] Gather feedback from MCP server developers
- [ ] Consider promoting to production if no issues arise

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add metrics and monitoring for OAuth flow success rates
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for authorization attempts
- [ ] Add support for additional OAuth scopes if needed
- [ ] Consider implementing OAuth 2.1 features

## Quick Reference

### Current Architecture
- **Stack**: `ib-oauth-stack` (single stack with Lambda aliases)
- **Region**: `us-west-1`
- **API ID**: `66qz7xd2w8`

## Support Information

### For Third-Party Integrators
The OAuth bridge is ready for integration. Key points:
- No pre-registration required
- Standard OAuth 2.0 flow with PKCE support
- Token refresh supported (1,000 max refreshes per session)
- Session expires after IB's `logintimeoutperiod` (typically 24 hours)
- Complete documentation available in [`docs/`](./docs/) directory

### For Developers
All code is deployed and operational. The system uses:
- Popup window for IB login (not iframe)
- Accept header content negotiation
- Polling mechanism for login completion detection
- DynamoDB for state and token storage
- Lambda aliases for environment management

## Conclusion

The OAuth bridge is now **production-ready** and successfully integrates with third-party applications like MCP servers. All critical issues have been resolved, the system has been verified working end-to-end, and comprehensive documentation is in place.
