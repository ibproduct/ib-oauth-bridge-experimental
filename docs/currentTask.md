# Current Task: Documentation Review and Architecture Update

## Context
The OAuth bridge project has successfully migrated from a two-stack architecture to a single-stack architecture using Lambda aliases. This improves cost efficiency, simplifies deployment, and provides better version control.

## Current Status
- âœ… Single-stack architecture implemented (see [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md))
- âœ… Lambda aliases configured (dev â†’ $LATEST, main â†’ published versions)
- âœ… API Gateway stages deployed (dev and main)
- âœ… Old stacks deleted and cleaned up
- âœ… New endpoints verified and operational
- âœ… Core documentation updated with new architecture
- ðŸ”„ Remaining documentation review in progress

## Recent Work Completed

### Documentation Review âœ…
All documentation has been reviewed and updated:
- âœ… api-documentation.md - Updated with new endpoints and table names
- âœ… architecture.md - Updated deployment architecture
- âœ… client-integration.md - Updated all code examples
- âœ… monitoring.md - Updated log groups and monitoring commands
- âœ… oauth-flow-mapping.md - Updated API Gateway configuration
- âœ… testing.md - Updated endpoints and commands
- âœ… development-workflow.md - Merged production deployment procedures
- âœ… currentTask.md - Updated to reflect current state
- âœ… Removed obsolete files:
  - production-deployment.md (merged into development-workflow.md)
  - implementation-plan.md (task-specific, no longer relevant)
  - MIGRATION.md (migration complete, no longer needed)

## Next Steps

**Future Enhancements** (when prioritized):
- PKCE support for enhanced security
- Additional monitoring and alerting
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced error handling
