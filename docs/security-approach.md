# Security Approach: Working with IB API Limitations

## IB API Limitations

### 1. Device Binding Limitations
- No support for custom headers for device binding
- Cannot implement traditional device fingerprinting
- Alternative: Enhanced session monitoring and anomaly detection

### 2. Session Management Constraints
- Limited to /logout endpoint for session termination
- No custom session validation endpoints
- Mitigation: Implement local session enhancement layer

### 3. Permission Model
- Permissions mirror IB platform user permissions
- No custom scope validation possible
- Approach: Document inherited permission model

### 4. Authentication Constraints
- Standard OAuth flow with IB-specific session handling
- No custom authentication methods
- Solution: Implement PKCE for enhanced security

## Security Enhancement Strategy

### 1. PKCE Implementation (Priority)
- Independent of IB API limitations
- Provides enhanced security for public clients
- Prevents authorization code interception
- Implementation doesn't require IB API changes

### 2. Enhanced Session Management
- Local session monitoring and validation
- Proactive token rotation
- Anomaly detection for suspicious activity
- Integration with IB logout endpoint

### 3. Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention
- Per-client rate limiting
- Adaptive throttling based on usage patterns
- DDoS protection at API Gateway level
- Automated abuse detection and prevention

### 4. Comprehensive Monitoring
- Session creation and usage tracking
- Token refresh pattern analysis
- Failed authentication monitoring
- Real-time alerting for suspicious activity

## Implementation Priorities

1. PKCE Support
   - Immediate security improvement
   - Independent of IB API limitations
   - High impact for public client security

2. Session Enhancement
   - Work within IB API constraints
   - Add local security layer
   - Implement proactive monitoring

3. Documentation
   - Clear security model explanation
   - Implementation guides
   - Best practices for clients

4. Production Hardening
   - CloudWatch alerts
   - DDoS protection
   - Audit logging
   - Anomaly detection

## Success Metrics

1. Security
   - Zero unauthorized access incidents
   - Rapid detection of suspicious activity
   - Effective rate limiting
   - Comprehensive audit trail

2. User Experience
