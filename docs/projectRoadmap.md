  * Implemented session expiry tracking
  * Added refresh count tracking
- [x] Implement integrated proxy endpoint
  * Added proxy handler with session validation
  * Enhanced IB client service with error handling
  * Configured API Gateway route with CORS
- [x] Implement proper JWT handling for development
- [x] Add session management improvements
  * 5-minute refresh window
  * Configurable refresh limits
  * Session age validation

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Client Integration âœ…
- [x] Create client integration guide
- [x] Implement example clients
- [x] Add API documentation
- [x] Create usage examples
- [x] Document error handling
- [x] Implement userinfo endpoint

### ðŸ”’ Phase 4: Security & Production Readiness
- [ ] Implement PKCE support
  * Code verifier/challenge generation
  * Authorization endpoint updates
  * Token exchange validation
  * SDK examples
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Add security headers
- [ ] Set up audit logging
- [ ] Configure DDoS protection
- [ ] Set up production environment
- [ ] Integrate IB logout endpoint
- [ ] Implement token rotation
- [ ] Add session monitoring
- Note: Token binding not possible due to IB API limitations

## Current Tasks

### 1. PKCE Implementation
- Add code verifier/challenge generation
- Update authorization endpoint
- Modify token exchange flow
- Update client SDKs
- Add documentation and examples

### 2. Session Security Enhancement
- Integrate with IB logout endpoint
- Implement token rotation strategy
- Add session monitoring
- Configure rate limiting
- Document session limitations
Note: Working within IB API constraints:
- No custom device binding
- Permissions mirror IB platform
- Limited session management options

### 3. Documentation Updates
- [x] Document security model and limitations
- [x] Update API documentation
- [x] Create integration guide
- [ ] Add PKCE examples
- [ ] Explain permission inheritance
- [x] Document error handling
- [x] Document userinfo endpoint

### 4. Testing & Validation
- Test PKCE implementation
- Validate session management
- Test error scenarios
- Document test cases

## Production Planning

### Environment Setup
1. Infrastructure Architecture (Single-Stack with Lambda Aliases)
   - Single CloudFormation stack: `ib-oauth-stack`
   - Lambda aliases: `dev` (â†’ $LATEST) and `main` (â†’ published versions)
   - API Gateway stages: dev and main
   - Shared DynamoDB tables
   - See [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for migration details

2. Development Infrastructure
   - OAuth endpoints
   - Proxy integration
   - Test environment
   - Monitoring setup
   - Dev alias automatically updated with each deployment

3. Production Infrastructure
   - Main alias pointing to published versions
   - Enhanced security
   - Monitoring by alias
   - Version-based rollback capability

### Deployment Process
1. Development Phase
   - Implement features
   - Deploy to update $LATEST
   - Test on dev stage
   - Document changes
   - Verify functionality

2. Production Promotion
   - Publish Lambda versions
   - Update main alias to new versions
   - Test on main stage
   - Monitor performance
   - Rollback if needed

3. Migration from Two-Stack Architecture
   - See [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for complete guide
   - Backup existing stacks
   - Delete old dev and prod stacks
   - Deploy new single stack
   - Update client endpoints
   - Verify functionality

## Completion Criteria

### Development Environment
- All endpoints functional
- Proxy working correctly
- Token management complete
- Testing suite passing
- Documentation updated
- âœ… Single-stack architecture implemented
- âœ… Lambda aliases configured
- âœ… Migration guide created

### Production Environment
- Infrastructure deployed with Lambda aliases
- Security measures active
- Monitoring configured by alias
- Version management tested
- Rollback procedures verified
- Documentation complete
- Client applications updated with new endpoints

## Timeline

### Phase 2: Enhanced Authentication
Week 1-2:
- Token storage enhancement

- Basic testing

Week 3-4:
- Security improvements
- Integration testing
- Documentation updates

### Phase 3: Client Integration
Week 5-6:
- Client examples
- API documentation
- Usage guides
- Integration testing

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
Week 7-8:
