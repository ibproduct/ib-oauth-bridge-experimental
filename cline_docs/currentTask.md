# Current Task: Debug Form Submission in Dev Environment

## Testing Environment
- Local development server: Working perfectly on port 3001
- Dev environment: Deployed to AWS with test API client
- Test API client: Hosted on CloudFront for integration testing

## Context
The OAuth server is working perfectly in local development, and we're now testing the dev environment deployment with a hosted test API client. The form submission issue only appears in the dev environment, not locally.

## Current Status
- ✅ Local development server (port 3001): Fully functional
- ✅ Dev environment infrastructure deployed
- ✅ Test API client hosted on CloudFront
- ❌ Form submission not working in dev environment

## Active Issues
1. Form Submission Problem
   - URL clears after submission
   - JavaScript error on line 278
   - Form data not reaching Lambda
   - CORS configuration being refined

2. Environment Differences
   - Local: Direct Express server access on port 3001
   - Dev: CloudFront → API Gateway → Lambda
   - Test Client: Hosted on CloudFront for consistent testing

## Today's Progress
1. Infrastructure Updates
   - Moved CORS handling to Lambda functions
   - Simplified API Gateway to proxy mode
   - Added detailed error logging
   - Updated test client configuration

2. Documentation Updates
   - Created debug-progress.md for tracking
   - Updated monitoring.md with debug focus
   - Refreshed codebaseSummary.md

## Immediate Tasks
1. [ ] Debug JavaScript error on line 278
2. [ ] Add detailed Lambda event logging
3. [ ] Verify CORS headers in production
4. [ ] Test form submission data flow

## Next Steps
1. Once form submission is working:
   - Set up proper monitoring
   - Add CloudWatch alarms
   - Implement user info endpoint
   - Plan production deployment

## Notes
- Local testing shows correct behavior
- AWS infrastructure is properly configured
- Focus is on debugging client-side issues
- Need to improve error visibility
