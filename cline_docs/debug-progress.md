# Debug Progress

## Current Issue
Form submission not working in dev environment while working fine locally.

## Environment URLs
- API Endpoint: https://n4h948fv4c.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/
- Test Client: https://d3p9mz3wmmolll.cloudfront.net

## Testing Setup
1. Local Development
   - Express server running on port 3001
   - Direct server access for testing
   - All features working correctly

2. Dev Environment Testing
   - AWS infrastructure deployed
   - Test API client hosted on CloudFront
   - Using IntelligenceBank proxy for API calls

### Symptoms
1. URL clears after form submission
2. JavaScript error on line 278 in authorize endpoint: "SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token"
3. Form data not reaching Lambda function
4. Working perfectly in local development

### Root Cause Identified
The JavaScript error was caused by template variable handling in the authorize endpoint:
1. HTML template contained both OAuth parameters (`{{client_id}}`) and JavaScript template literals
2. Template replacement logic only handled OAuth parameters
3. Unprocessed template variables in JavaScript code caused syntax errors
4. This only affected the deployed version because local development used a different template handling approach

### Environment Differences
1. Local Development
   - Express server on port 3001
   - Direct server access
   - No CORS issues
   - Working form submission

2. Dev Environment (AWS)
   - CloudFront distribution for static content
   - API Gateway with Lambda proxy integration
   - Lambda functions for OAuth endpoints
   - CORS and proxy server integration
   - CloudWatch logs for debugging

### Recent Changes
1. ✅ Moved CORS handling to Lambda
2. ✅ Added detailed error logging
3. ✅ Fixed IB authentication flow
4. ✅ Simplified login URL generation
5. ✅ Added response logging
6. ✅ Updated Lambda function with changes

### Environment Differences Found
1. Local Development (Express Server):
   - Uses distinct paths: `/authorize/start` for POST
   - Direct routing without API Gateway
   - Works with path-based routing

2. Production (API Gateway):
   - Uses single path: `/authorize` for both GET/POST
   - API Gateway maps methods to handlers
   - Requires matching API Gateway path structure

### Debug Steps Completed
1. High Priority
   - [x] Added detailed client-side logging
   - [x] Updated CORS headers in Lambda responses
   - [x] Configured IntelligenceBank proxy
   - [x] Fixed template variable handling in authorize endpoint
   - [ ] Test form submission with new changes
   - [ ] Monitor CloudWatch logs for errors

### Fix Implementation
1. Modified template variable handling in authorize endpoint to:
   - Process OAuth parameters (`{{client_id}}`, etc.)
   - Preserve JavaScript template literals
   - Remove any remaining unprocessed template variables
2. Added better error logging for debugging

2. Investigation Areas
   - [ ] Form submission data flow
   - [ ] API Gateway request mapping
   - [ ] Lambda event structure
   - [ ] CloudWatch logs analysis

### Working Components
1. Infrastructure
   - ✅ CloudFront distribution
   - ✅ S3 bucket for static hosting
   - ✅ API Gateway endpoints
   - ✅ Lambda functions deployed
   - ✅ DynamoDB tables

2. Functionality
   - ✅ Static content serving
   - ✅ HTTPS endpoints
   - ✅ Basic API responses
   - ❌ Form submission
   - ❌ OAuth flow completion

### Debug Tools
1. AWS Console
   - CloudWatch Logs
   - API Gateway Test Console
   - Lambda Test Events
   - CloudFront Monitoring

2. Browser Tools
   - Network Tab
   - Console Logs
   - CORS Debugging
   - Request/Response Inspector

## Next Steps
1. Next Actions
   - Test form submission at https://d3p9mz3wmmolll.cloudfront.net
   - Verify IB authentication flow:
     1. Initial token request to /v1/auth/app/token
     2. Login page load with /auth/?login=0&token={{content}}
     3. Polling /v1/auth/app/info?token={{content}}
   - Check CloudWatch logs for response data

### Latest Fix
1. Root Cause: Incorrect IB Authentication Flow
   - Wrong URL construction for login page
   - Extra parameters not needed by IB
   - Missing proper flow sequence
   
2. Solution:
   - Matched exact IB authentication steps
   - Simplified login URL generation
   - Added logging for each step
   - Removed unnecessary parameters

2. If Issues Persist
   - Test with simplified form
   - Try direct API Gateway access
   - Implement step-by-step debugging
   - Review similar patterns in other projects
